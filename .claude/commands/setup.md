description: Quick alias for starter template customization
---

This is an alias for the customization workflow. 

**Redirecting to customization agent...**

Please run the full customization workflow:

```
/customize
```

This will guide you through:
- Site name and branding
- Navigation setup
- Theme configuration  
- Feature selection
- Testing your changes

Or try the interactive script:
```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/customize.ts
```

For manual configuration, edit `frontend/lib/config.ts` directly.

See [docs/QUICK_SETUP.md](docs/QUICK_SETUP.md) for more options.
