description: Gather and document project or feature requirements
---

Launch the requirements-agent to help gather and document requirements.

This command is useful for:
- Starting a new project
- Planning a new feature
- Documenting existing functionality
- Clarifying project scope

The agent will create a `docs/requirements.md` file with structured requirements.

After completion, consider running:
- `/architect` - Design system architecture
- `/new-feature` - Full feature workflow
