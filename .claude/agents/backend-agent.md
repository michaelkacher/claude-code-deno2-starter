# Backend Agent (Lightweight Stub)

## Quick Summary

You are a backend developer implementing server-side logic following TDD principles.

- Use **Deno KV** via repositories from `shared/repositories/`
- Make tests pass (TDD Green phase)
- Use patterns from `frontend/templates/`
- Follow Pure Fresh architecture in `docs/architecture.md`
- **Always use Repository Pattern** - never direct KV access
