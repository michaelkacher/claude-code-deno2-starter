# Quick Reference Guide

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27

This is a condensed reference for common patterns and workflows. For detailed guides, see `docs/guides/`.

## Stack Overview

- **Runtime:** Deno 2 (TypeScript-native, secure, edge-ready)
- **Backend:** Hono (ultra-fast, <12KB, edge-optimized)
- **Frontend:** Fresh + Preact (SSR, islands, optional)
- **Database:** Deno KV (built-in, zero-config, globally distributed)
- **Deployment:** Deno Deploy (serverless edge, auto-scaling)

---

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start development
deno task dev                    # Backend (8000) + Frontend (3000)

# Build feature (recommended)
/new-feature                     # Handles everything: requirements → tests → implementation

# Create UI mockup first
/mockup                          # Fast visual prototype
/new-feature                     # Converts mockup to full feature

# Testing
deno test                        # Run all tests
deno task test:watch             # Watch mode
deno task test:coverage          # Coverage report

# Code quality
deno task check                  # Lint + format + type check
deno fmt                         # Format code
deno lint                        # Lint code

# Deployment
deno task deploy                 # Deploy to Deno Deploy
git push origin main             # Auto-deploy via GitHub Actions
```

## Common Patterns

### API Endpoints (REST)

```typescript
// Standard CRUD pattern
GET    /api/resource             // List all
GET    /api/resource/:id         // Get one
POST   /api/resource             // Create
PUT    /api/resource/:id         // Update
DELETE /api/resource/:id         // Delete
```

### Deno KV Keys

```typescript
// Hierarchical key patterns
['users', userId]                    // User by ID
['users_by_email', email]            // Secondary index
['posts', postId]                    // Post by ID
['posts_by_user', userId, postId]    // User's posts
['comments', postId, commentId]      // Post's comments
```

### Response Format

```typescript
// Success
{ "data": { /* resource */ } }

// Error
{ "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human readable message" } }
```

## Token Optimization

### Feature-Scoped Development (Recommended)

```bash
/new-feature                     # Creates docs in features/proposed/[name]/
# vs global docs approach        # 40-50% fewer tokens
```

### Pattern References

Agents automatically use templates from:
- `backend/templates/` - Service & route patterns
- `frontend/templates/` - Component & page patterns
- `tests/templates/` - Test patterns

**Savings:** ~50-60% reduction per feature (from ~38K to ~14K tokens)

---

## TDD Workflow

```
1. RED:   Write failing test    (/write-tests)
2. GREEN: Write minimal code     (/implement-backend or /implement-frontend)
3. REFACTOR: Improve code        (while keeping tests green)
```

## Testing with Deno KV

```typescript
// In-memory KV for tests (fast, isolated)
const kv = await Deno.openKv(':memory:');

// Cleanup after tests
try {
  // ... test code
} finally {
  await kv.close();
}
```

## When to Migrate

### Deno KV → PostgreSQL
When you need:
- Complex JOINs across many tables
- Advanced aggregations (GROUP BY with HAVING)
- Full-text search at database level
- Analytics/reporting queries

### Monolith → Microservices
When you have:
- 10+ developers
- Clear domain boundaries
- Different scaling needs per service
- 100K+ users

## Slash Commands Quick Ref

| Command | Use Case | When to Use |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `/new-feature` | Build complete feature | 90% of development |
| `/mockup` | Visual prototype | UI-heavy features |
| `/design` | Update design system | Rebrand, customize styling |
| `/write-tests` | TDD Red phase | Manual control |
| `/implement-backend` | Backend code | Manual control |
| `/implement-frontend` | Frontend UI | Manual control |
| `/review` | Code review | Before merging |
| `/requirements` | Project docs | Large projects (10+ features) |
| `/architect` | Update architecture | DB migration, microservices |

---

## Best Practices

### Code
- ✅ YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It
- ✅ KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid
- ✅ DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
- ✅ Test first (TDD)

### Architecture
- ✅ Start simple, scale later
- ✅ Use boring, proven technology
- ✅ Avoid premature optimization
- ✅ Clear separation: Routes → Services → Database

### Testing
- ✅ Test business logic (not frameworks)
- ✅ Use in-memory KV for speed
- ✅ AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- ✅ One assertion per test

---

## Common Issues

### "Port already in use"
```bash
# Kill processes on ports 3000 and 8000
deno task kill-ports
# Then restart: deno task dev
```

### "Permission Denied"
```bash
# Deno requires explicit permissions
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env backend/main.ts
# Or use deno task dev (permissions in deno.json)
```

### "Module not found"
```bash
# Always include .ts extension in imports
import { foo } from './bar.ts';  // ✅ Correct
import { foo } from './bar';      // ❌ Wrong
```

### "Tests failing"
```bash
# Ensure using in-memory KV for tests
const kv = await Deno.openKv(':memory:');
```

## Token Optimization Summary

| Approach | Tokens/Feature | Speed | Use When |
|----------|----------------|-------|----------|
| **Feature-scoped + patterns** | ~14K | Fast | New features (recommended) |
| Feature-scoped only | ~20K | Fast | Basic features |
| Global docs | ~38K | Slower | Initial setup |

**Recommendation:** Always use `/new-feature` for 40-50% token savings.
