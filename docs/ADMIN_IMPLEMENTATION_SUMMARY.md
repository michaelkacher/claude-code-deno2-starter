## Testing

### 1. Create Admin User

```bash
# Make existing user an admin
deno task users:make-admin test@example.com
```

### 2. Log In

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
- Email: test@example.com
- Password: password123

### 3. Access Admin Panel

- Click "Admin Panel" button in navigation
- Or go to http://localhost:3000/admin/users

### 4. Test Features

- View statistics
- Search for users
- Filter by role/verification
- Try each action button
- Test pagination

---

## CLI Commands

```bash
# List all users
deno task users:list

# Make user an admin
deno task users:make-admin email@example.com
```

## Architecture

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in → receives JWT token
2. Token stored in localStorage (frontend) and cookie (server-side)
3. Admin panel checks token + role on page load
4. Every API call includes token in Authorization header
5. `requireAdmin()` middleware verifies token and role from database

### Data Flow

```
Frontend Island (AdminUserTable.tsx)
    ↓ fetch with token
Backend Routes (admin.ts)
    ↓ requireAdmin() middleware
    ↓ verifies token + checks role
Deno KV Database
    ↓ user data
Response with JSON
    ↓
Frontend updates UI
```

### Security Layers

1. **Frontend**: Redirect if not admin (UX improvement)
2. **Server**: Handler checks role before rendering
3. **API**: Middleware blocks non-admin requests
4. **Database**: Role verified from source of truth

---

## Statistics

### Lines of Code

- Backend: 467 lines (admin-auth.ts + routes/admin.ts)
- Frontend: 711 lines (users.tsx + AdminUserTable.tsx)
- Scripts: 100 lines (make-admin.ts + list-users.ts)
- Documentation: 714 lines
- **Total: ~2,000 lines**

### Endpoints Added

- 7 new API endpoints
- 1 new frontend route
- 1 new island component

### Commands Added

- `users:list` - List all users
- `users:make-admin` - Promote user to admin

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing

1. ✅ Verify servers are running
2. ✅ Make test user an admin
3. ✅ Log in and access admin panel
4. Test all features (search, filter, actions)
5. Try different user scenarios

### Production Deployment

1. Create first admin user via CLI script
2. Set up audit logging
3. Add rate limiting to admin endpoints
4. Configure monitoring and alerts
5. Review security policies

### Future Enhancements

- Bulk operations (select multiple users)
- Export to CSV
- User activity logs
- Last login timestamp
- Advanced filtering (date ranges)
- Admin role hierarchy
- Email notifications for admin actions
