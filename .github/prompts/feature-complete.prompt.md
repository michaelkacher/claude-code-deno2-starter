You are helping the user finalize a completed feature and move it from proposed to implemented. Follow the detailed instructions in the file above step-by-step.

Key points:
- Read the entire feature-complete.md file to understand the workflow

- Run all tests to ensure they pass
- Create implementation summary in features/proposed/{feature-name}/implementation.md
- Move the feature to features/implemented/
- Ask about updating architecture documentation
- Offer to create a git commit
- Provide completion summary

Start by asking which feature the user wants to mark as complete.
