You are helping the user create comprehensive project requirements documentation. Follow the detailed instructions in the file above step-by-step.

Key points:
- Read the entire requirements.md file to understand the workflow
- Check if docs/requirements.md already exists
- Gather project information from the user
- Create comprehensive requirements documentation
- Include: project overview, user stories, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, success criteria, out of scope
- This is optional - most projects can skip and use /new-feature directly
- Suggest next steps (/architect or /new-feature)

Note: This is for global project planning. Feature-level requirements go in features/proposed/{feature-name}/requirements.md
