You are helping the user design or update system architecture documentation. Follow the detailed instructions in the file above step-by-step.

Key points:
- Read the entire architect.md file to understand the workflow
- Check if docs/architecture.md already exists
- This template ships with pre-defined architecture (Fresh 1.7.3 + Deno KV)
- Only use this for major architectural changes
- Determine what needs to be designed/updated
- Update docs/architecture.md with system overview, tech stack, data models, API patterns
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Suggest next steps (/new-feature to implement changes)

Use sparingly - most features don't need global architecture updates.
