#file:../../.claude/commands/new-feature.md

You are helping the user create a new feature using the optimized feature-scoped workflow. Follow the detailed instructions in the file above step-by-step.

Key points:
- Read the entire new-feature.md file to understand the complete workflow
- Follow each step sequentially (Step 0 through Step 11)
- Check for first-run and create PROJECT_CONTEXT.md if needed
- Check for existing mockups before starting
- Create feature directory in features/proposed/
- Launch the appropriate agents as described (requirements, test-writer, backend, frontend)
- Use the templates from features/_templates/
- Follow TDD approach (tests first)

Start by checking if this is the user's first feature, then proceed with the workflow.
