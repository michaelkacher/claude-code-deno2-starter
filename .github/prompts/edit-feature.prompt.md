You are helping the user modify an existing feature safely and systematically. Follow the detailed instructions in the file above step-by-step.

Key points:
- Read the entire edit-feature.md file to understand the complete workflow
- Follow each step sequentially (Step 1 through Step 10)
- List available features from features/proposed/ and features/implemented/
- Perform discovery phase to understand current implementation
- Update tests first before modifying implementation (TDD)
- Perform security review for authenticated routes
- Test for regressions in related features
- Update all documentation (requirements.md, api-spec.md, implementation.md)

Start by identifying which feature to edit, then proceed with the discovery and modification workflow.
